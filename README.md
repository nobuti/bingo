Bingo is a game of probability in which players mark off numbers on cards as the numbers are drawn randomly by a caller, the winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers. It's kind a tradition in our family to play Bingo the first day of the year. We used the called "bolas" until we lost some of them. So this year, I was asked to build a Bingo game.

Still work in progress. In one morning I was able to make a "bombo". I plan to make the whole game, to be played with mobile devices at all.
